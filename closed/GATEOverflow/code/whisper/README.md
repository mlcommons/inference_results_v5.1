## Speech to Text using Whisper

MLCommons Reference implementation (vLLM) is used to run the Whisper model using the [MLCFlow automation](https://github.com/mlcommons/mlcflow).
 
Please see [MLPerf inference docs](https://docs.mlcommons.org/inference/benchmarks/speech_to_text/whisper/) for the run commands to be followed.
