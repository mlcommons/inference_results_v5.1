## Text Summarization using PointPainting

MLCommons Reference implementation (vLLM) is used to run the PointPainting model using the [MLCFlow automation](https://github.com/mlcommons/mlcflow).
 
Please see [MLPerf inference docs](https://docs.mlcommons.org/inference/benchmarks/language/llama3_1-8b/) for the run commands to be followed.
