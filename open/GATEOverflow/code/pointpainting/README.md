## 3D Object-detection using PointPainting

MLCommons Reference implementation (Pytorch) is used to run the PointPainting model using the [MLCFlow automation](https://github.com/mlcommons/mlcflow).
 
Please see [MLPerf inference docs](https://docs.mlcommons.org/inference/benchmarks/automotive/3d_object_detection/pointpainting/) for the run commands to be followed.
